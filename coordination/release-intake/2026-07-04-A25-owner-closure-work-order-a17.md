## Owner

## Validation Hold

- Status: waiting-for-owner-compose-deletion-confirmation
- Active owner worktree: `/Users/dongpinhu/.config/superpowers/worktrees/MAIS-MVP/A10-A22-A08-A12-A06-compose-20260628`
- Reason: Owner reported active exact deletion in this compose worktree; linked-worktree archive, Wave 06, aggregate remediation, and completion-audit refreshes should wait for owner confirmation.
- Resume condition: Owner confirms exact deletion in the compose worktree is complete.

## Next Safe Actions

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and this work order.
2. Work only inside the listed owner scope or write a blocker report.
3. Resolve package blockers in an isolated owner worktree, or record a formal blocker.
4. Do not run any physical cleanup unless a current authorization artifact and owner instruction name the exact approval ID, final state, command, and working directory.

## Owner

- Agent: A07
- Owner: A07 AI tutor lead
- Role: AI tutor/provider integration lead
- Report ID: `owner-package-blocker-report-a07`
- Assignment ID: `owner-package-blocker-a07`
- Report fingerprint: `101a645932997ca7d6faf47bd8f22a907b691e872efe81c16fe21e0878a00cb0`
- Recommended worktree: `/Users/dongpinhu/.config/superpowers/worktrees/MAIS-MVP/A07-ai-tutor-closure`
- Cleanup authorized: false
- Executable now: false

## Objective

Resolve or formally block the owner-package blockers routed to A07 without widening beyond AGENTS.md owner scope.

## Required Owner Decision

The owner session should either resolve the package blockers inside its allowed scope or record a formal blocker report. A valid report must state:

- owner decision: resolved, partially resolved, or blocked
- blocker summary
- evidence reviewed
- checks run and results
- next action
- stop condition, if owner input or cross-owner work is required

Suggested next action: Use `/Users/dongpinhu/.config/superpowers/worktrees/MAIS-MVP/A07-ai-tutor-closure` to resolve the routed blockers inside A07's allowed write scope, or copy this draft into the owner blocker records file with reportStatus=recorded-owner-blocker and a concrete blocker summary then rerun `npm run type-check -- --pretty false`.

## Package Blockers

| Matrix row | Package | Failed checks | Blocking reasons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wave-05-visualization-ai-runtime:a07-ai-tutor | A07 AI tutor | typeCheck<br>aiTutorPlaywright | A07 AI tutor typeCheck failed<br>A07 AI tutor aiTutorPlaywright failed |

## Failed Check Commands

| Package | Check | Command | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A07 AI tutor | typeCheck | `npm run type-check -- --pretty false` | 2 |
| A07 AI tutor | aiTutorPlaywright | `npx playwright test tests/e2e/ai-tutor-deepseek.spec.ts tests/e2e/ai-tutor-live-text.spec.ts --project=desktop-chrome` | 1 |

## Write Scope

- `app/api/ai-tutor/resolve/route.ts`

## Coordination Required

- none

## Checks To Rerun Or Cite

- `node coordination/release-intake/assert-owner-package-blocker-assignment-packet-current.mjs`
- `node coordination/release-intake/assert-dirty-worktree-remediation-current.mjs`

## Stop Conditions

- `Stop if the fix requires adding/removing package dependencies without A10/A22 approval.`
- `Stop if the fix requires shared type/schema changes without A08 coordination.`
- `Stop if a routed file is outside this owner's write scope and no explicit scope expansion exists.`
- `Stop if the assignment needs owner-approved Git operations; A25 evidence alone is not authorization.`
- `Stop if the work would expose or edit real secrets.`
